##MolecularOCRcrnn
Molecular OCR using convolutional recurrent neural networks

#Built on
This workflow is built on keras (using Theano). It also makes use of scikit-image (skimage) and the scientific python stack. Features are calculated based on SD files using RDkit.

#Acquiring data
As input data, place a dump of SD files (named "unique_id_XXXX.sdf") in data/SDF/. 

Compute features using `python fromSDFs.py`

Process features using `python ocrfeatures.py`
